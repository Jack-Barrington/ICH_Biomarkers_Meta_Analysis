# ICH_Biomarkers_Meta_Analysis
This repository contains a walkthrough of the meta-analysis performed for our systematic review determining the association between circulating inflammatory biomarkers and outcome following intracerebral haemorrhage.

You will find the code in the Output/WBC.rmd file and the filtering strategy (line 60) can be modified to run the code on any biomarker. 
You should also be able to download and view the associated html markdown document with a nicely formatted output of the rmd file.

I will add the Clean_data file once the manuscript has been accepted for publication!

All analysis was done using the amazing metafor package.
